PROJECT OVERVIEW:- This project constitutes a morse code interfacing functionality for the Nexys A7 FPGA Board. It encompasses the use of a VGA, an external Keyboard, and the board's Seven Segment Display. With the help of the VGA, shapes corresponding to the "dot" and "dash" of Morse Code are visible to the user. The Keyboard is used for user input as a "Guess" for the corresponding morse code on the screen. Finally a Seven Segment Display is used as a visual aid for the user to see the word shown in morse in the screen.
